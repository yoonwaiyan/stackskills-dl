## Information

❗️ This is a **non-official** Ruby script to download all StackSkills tutorials. Login email and password is required to get your list of subscribed courses. ❗️

Being inspired by some popular downloader libraries(youtube-dl, udemy-dl etc.) and no downloader library available for StackSkills(or SkillWise) courses, I've decided to put on this small scraping library to help you download the courses to your machine for offline viewing and take it as part of my Ruby learning and contributing to open source community.

This library will by default get all your subscribed courses and download them all into your local filesystem, structured into folders of course sections in each course and folders of lectures of each course section. The courses will be available in your `/downloads` folder within this repo. Extra options are available to download only one course based on the course ID or slug.
